👨‍🎓 I am a dedicated, passionate researcher and educator specializing in large-scale evaluation and quantitative research methodologies (e.g., survey, intervention). 

🔍 My research expertise spans the design and implementation of innovative educational interventions, survey-based research designs, structural equation modelling, and the development of conceptual frameworks that integrate various educational constructs. 

🔬 Through rigorous empirical inquiry, I have advanced understanding in research areas such as regulation of learning, blended learning, student engagement, teaching practices, large-scale evaluation, and more recently, implications of GenAI on students’ learning, with findings published in esteemed academic platforms and peer-reviewed journals.

🛠️ I have a proven track record of leading institutional research projects, cross-institutional collaborations, evidence-based learning interventions, supervising undergraduate students, mentoring junior researchers, teaching learners from across the secondary and higher education spectrum, and service contributions in various capacities. 

📝 Recognized for my expertise in educational research methodologies, I have conducted workshops at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and delivered invited talks, most notably “Foundations of Educational Research Methodology: Research Design and Data Collection Methods” at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

🌐  Skilled in large-scale evaluation, I design and evaluate frameworks to improve educational initiatives, leveraging data-driven insights from structural equation modelling to foster continuous improvement and enhance learner outcomes. 

🌉 My work emphasizes bridging theory and practice, supporting institutional and departmental goals through evidence-based strategies, addressing diverse stakeholder needs.
