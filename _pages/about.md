I am a dedicated, passionate researcher and educator specializing in large-scale evaluation and quantitative research methodologies (e.g., survey, intervention). My research expertise spans the design and implementation of innovative educational interventions, survey-based research designs, structural equation modelling, and the development of conceptual frameworks that integrate various educational constructs. Through rigorous empirical inquiry, I have advanced understanding in research areas such as regulation of learning, blended learning, student engagement, teaching practices, large-scale evaluation, and more recently, implications of GenAI on students‚Äô learning, with findings published in esteemed academic platforms and peer-reviewed journals.

I have a proven track record of leading institutional research projects, cross-institutional collaborations, evidence-based learning interventions, supervising undergraduate students, mentoring junior researchers, teaching learners from across the secondary and higher education spectrum, and service contributions in various capacities. Recognized for my expertise in educational research methodologies, I have conducted workshops at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and delivered invited talks, most notably ‚ÄúFoundations of Educational Research Methodology: Research Design and Data Collection Methods‚Äù at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

Skilled in large-scale evaluation, I design and evaluate frameworks to improve educational initiatives, leveraging data-driven insights from structural equation modelling to foster continuous improvement and enhance learner outcomes. My work emphasizes bridging theory and practice, supporting institutional and departmental goals through evidence-based strategies, addressing diverse stakeholder needs.

With a deep commitment to teaching, learning, and research excellence, I am passionate about advancing innovative educational practices and contributing to the professional development of educators and students alike. My passion for teaching is complemented by a strong research foundation, allowing me to bridge theory and practice effectively in educational environments.

#Site-wide configuration
#------
#The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

#Create content & metadata
#------
#For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

#**Markdown generator**

#The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

#How to edit your site's GitHub repository
#------
#Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

#For more info
#------
#More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
